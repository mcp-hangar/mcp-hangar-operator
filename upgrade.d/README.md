# Upgrade-note fragments

A PR whose change a reader has to act on drops **one new file** here instead of
editing `UPGRADE.md`. At release time `scripts/promote_upgrade_notes.py` folds
them into a single `## Upgrade to <version>` section of `UPGRADE.md` and
deletes them.

This exists for the reason `changelog.d/` does. Every PR with an upgrade note
used to add an `## Unreleased -- <headline>` section at the top of
`UPGRADE.md`, so any two such PRs conflicted at the same spot, and each merge
left every other open PR dirty -- every PR of the 0.17.5 round. Nothing ever
gave those sections a version either: 0.17.5 shipped with eight of them still
headed `Unreleased`. A fragment is a new file, so there is nothing for git to
merge, and the release gives it its version.

## When

A change that breaks callers, changes a CRD field or a default, or changes what
an existing manifest does gets a note here, as well as its `changelog.d/`
fragment. The changelog says what changed; the note says how to move across it.

## Naming

```text
upgrade.d/<id>-<slug>.md
```

- `<id>` -- the issue or PR number, as in `changelog.d/`. It is the sort key:
  notes appear in the released section in file-name order.
- `<slug>` -- a few words, kebab-case. Reusing the `<id>-<slug>` of the PR's
  changelog fragment keeps the two easy to pair.

```text
upgrade.d/235-configmap-source-namespace.md
```

## Content

The first line is the note's heading at level three, and the rest of the file is
its body in markdown:

```markdown
### a ConfigMap discovery source can no longer read another namespace

An `MCPDiscoverySource` of type `ConfigMap` used to read ...
```

- The heading becomes a `###` subsection of `## Upgrade to <version>` exactly as
  written. Write it the way the headings already in `UPGRADE.md` read: what is
  now true.
- A subsection inside the note starts at `####`.
- No `## Unreleased` heading and no version: the promoter adds the version.
- Write for a reader upgrading, not for a reviewer: name the old and the new
  form, say what breaks and what to change.

## Release

`scripts/assemble_release_changelog.sh` runs the promoter on the release-please
branch, in the same commit as the changelog assembly. Any `## Unreleased --`
sections still in `UPGRADE.md` come first, in file order, then the fragments by
file name. It is not something to run by hand on a feature branch.

A PR opened before this directory existed may still carry an `## Unreleased --
<headline>` section at the top of `UPGRADE.md`. The promoter still reads it, so
the note ships either way; moving it into a fragment is what stops the PR
conflicting.

`python3 scripts/promote_upgrade_notes.py extract --version <version>` prints
one released section.
