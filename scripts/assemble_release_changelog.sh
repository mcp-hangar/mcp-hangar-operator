# right after it in the same job and commits the assembled section onto the same

# notes in one squash commit, exactly as before -- what changed is where the
# prose comes from (per-PR fragments instead of one contested block).

# main, which drops this commit and restores the fragments. The next run redoes
# it. A branch that already carries its section is a no-op success.

# attributed to the pull request's author, the release app. So every release
# PR's checks sat in `action_required` waiting for a human, while the merge was
# refused with "13 of 13 required status checks are expected" (#1184).
#
# The release app is not a first-time contributor -- it authors and merges a

#
# The first version of this guessed at the cause: it compared PUSH_TOKEN to
# GH_TOKEN, on the reasoning that a push made with the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN
# does not trigger workflows. That reasoning is sound and the condition was
# still wrong -- on the run it was written for, the app token WAS available, so
# the comparison was false and the recovery never ran. The release PR sat with
# 13 required checks "expected" anyway (#1173).
#
# What actually happened, from the API rather than from inference: the runs
# existed, they belonged to `github-actions[bot]`, and they produced nothing --
# ten runs with zero jobs and `conclusion: failure` on one head, ten runs in
# `action_required` on the next. Re-firing the same workflows as a human actor
# produced checks immediately, both times. So the condition worth testing is
# not which credential pushed, but whether the head ended up with any check
# runs at all -- which is the thing that blocks the merge, and the thing that
# is true whatever the underlying reason turns out to be (#1184).
#
# The underlying reason, found later: those runs belonged to
# `github-actions[bot]` because the push did. Git sent checkout's persisted
# GITHUB_TOKEN header instead of the app token in the URL (#1379).
#
# The grace period is for the ordinary case: a head that has just been pushed
# has no checks for a few seconds either way.
