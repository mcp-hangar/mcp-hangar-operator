# Start the checks on a release PR whose head was pushed with GITHUB_TOKEN.
#
# A push authenticated with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger
# workflows -- by design, to stop a run from re-triggering itself. When the
# changelog assembly falls back to it, the commit it pushes becomes the release
# PR's head and carries no runs at all, so every required check stays in
# "expected" and the merge is blocked for good: `--admin` does not clear a
# ruleset requirement, and the error message points at branch protection rather
# than at the missing runs (#1180, seen on the 2.17.1 release PR).
#
# Close/reopen fires `pull_request: reopened` against the head that is already
# there, so the checks run and no history is rewritten.
#
# Its own file so the recovery can be exercised without standing up a release:
# `scripts/tests/test_release_pr_checks_are_refired.py` runs it against a stub `gh`.
#
# The reopen is only as good as the credential it is made with. Pass the
# release app's token as GH_TOKEN. A reopen by `github-actions[bot]` produced
# runs with zero jobs and no check runs on 2.19.1 (#1377, #1379).
#
# Usage: refire_release_pr_checks.sh <branch>
# Inputs: GH_TOKEN (gh CLI; the app token, not GITHUB_TOKEN), GITHUB_REPOSITORY
# (defaults to the operator repo).
