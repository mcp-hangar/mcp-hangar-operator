"""A release PR pushed with GITHUB_TOKEN gets its checks started anyway.

A push authenticated with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger
workflows. When the changelog assembly falls back to it, the commit it pushes
becomes the release PR's head and carries no runs, so every required check sits
in "expected" -- not failing, missing -- and the merge is refused even with
`--admin`, because a ruleset requirement is not a branch-protection setting.
That is what happened to the 2.17.1 release PR (#1180): the app id was set, the
token step yielded nothing, and the only warning in the script was guarded on
the app being *unconfigured*, so nothing said a word.

`scripts/refire_release_pr_checks.sh` is the recovery -- close and reopen, which
fires `pull_request: reopened` on the head already there. It lives in its own
file so it can be run here against a stub `gh` rather than only on a release
day.

Ported from mcp-hangar core with the operator's repository, paths and titles.
