"""An upgrade note must not ship still headed "Next".

Eight `## Next` sections accumulated in `UPGRADE.md` while 2.7.0, 2.8.0 and
2.9.0 shipped, so the changelog for those releases pointed a reader at a section
that could not say which release it described (#983). Promotion now runs from
`assemble_release_changelog.sh`, which means it runs unattended on a release
branch -- and release-please force-pushes that branch, so it reruns on a tree it
has already rewritten. Both properties are tested here rather than discovered on
a release day.

A note is now a fragment in `upgrade.d/`, because every PR writing a `## Next`
section at the top of `UPGRADE.md` conflicted with every other one. The legacy
sections are still promoted, so a PR opened before the move still ships its
note; both sources, and the two together, are tested below.

Ported from mcp-hangar core. The operator's legacy sections are headed
`## Unreleased -- <headline>`, not core's `## Next — <headline>`; both forms are
exercised here.
