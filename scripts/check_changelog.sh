# Core used to require a diff in CHANGELOG.md itself, under `## [Unreleased]`.
# That made one anchor in one file the write target for every open PR at once,
# so any two of them conflicted and the second to merge got a hand-resolve.
# A fragment is a new file per PR, so there is nothing for git to merge.
# `scripts/build_changelog.py` folds them into CHANGELOG.md at release time.

# Diff from the merge base, never from BASE_SHA itself. The workflow passes the

# the branch point as this PR's (#1337): a test-only PR owed a fragment for

# look ADDED by every branch cut before it. No fallback to two dots: without a

# dependency bump edits `go.mod`, a test-only PR adds `*_test.go` under
# `internal/`, a docs PR edits a Go doc comment. So every such PR failed a REQUIRED
# check and waited for somebody to hand-apply `skip-changelog`.
#
# Read from the title rather than the author or the paths: a human doing a
# dependency bump is treated like Dependabot, and the Conventional Commit type
# is the author's own statement about what the PR is. `pr-title / validate`
